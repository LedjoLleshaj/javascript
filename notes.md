## Notes i kept during the course.

Javascript is dynamically typed language, so we don't need to specify the type of the variable however there are 
7 Primitive data types in javascript

1. Number    ```js let num = 10; ```
2. String    ```js let str = "Hello"; ```
3. Boolean   ```js let bool = true; ```
4. Null      ```js let n = null; ``` 
5. Undefined ```js let u = undefined; ``` 
6. Symbol    ```js let sym = Symbol(); ```
7. BigInt    ```js let big = 10n; ```
